         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <hi>AN ANSWER</hi> To the Printed Paper abovementioned.</head>
            <p>TO the Firſt, it is Anſwered, That the Mayor and Burgeſſes of <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> have by <hi>Preſcription</hi> the Survey and Government of the Port and River there; which Port and River, are within the Bounds and Limits of the Borough of <hi>Newcaſtle.</hi> And the ſaid Mayor and Burgeſſes have from time to time (whereof the Memory of Man runs not to the contrary) had the ſole Vending of all Beer and Ale ſold to Ships Trading to that Port: And this is, in effect, no more than all Corporations by <hi>Preſcription</hi> enjoy, That none ſhall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe a Trade within their Corporation, but the Members of it. And it ſeems to be as reaſonable to take away the Priviledges of all other <hi>Corporations,</hi> as to take away this; and beſides, the Publick is no way inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; for Ships do not loſe their Voyages by it, becauſe the Ships may take in their Beer and Ale at <hi>Sheilds</hi> from <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> in a quarter of the time they can take in their Coals; for they go two, three, and ſometimes four Miles above <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> for their Coals. And this very Point, as to the ſole vending of Beer and Ale by the Mayor and Burgeſſes within the ſaid Port, has been lately Tryed in His Majeſties Court of Exchequer, and found by a ſubſtantial Jury for the Mayor and Burgeſſes, and a Decree thereupon made for the ſame.</p>
            <p>To the Second, it is Anſwered, That it is lawful in that Port, for any Ship-Maſter to uſe his own Carpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and if the Ship be in diſtreſs, the Maſter may uſe any Carpenters whatſoever at <hi>Sheilds:</hi> and beſides, Care is taken that there be alwayes Carpenters and Pilots that are Freemen of <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> that live at <hi>Sheilds,</hi> near the Mouth of the Haven, to ſerve ſuch Maſters of Ships as have occaſion to uſe their Services there, and that at Reaſonable Prices, lower than in other places. And the Mayor of <hi>Newcastle</hi> may regulate the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, if unreaſonable Demands be made; and it is a great Miſtake to affirm, That any Ships have been loſt in that Harbor, for want of Carpenters or Pilots, and the ſame cannot be proved.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:134665:2"/>
            <p>To the Third, the Anſwer is, That <hi>Jarrowſlike</hi> is no fit place for a Shore, being near the Mouth of the Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, becauſe the unavoidable fall of Ballaſt would make a Sand-Bed, which would hinder Ships to paſs in and out. It would be a Nuſance to have a Shore there, there being no Foundation to erect a Wall for a Ballaſt Key. And it would be further inconvenient, the Channel of the River being Narrow in that place, it would make the Current ſo quick, that no Ships could lie at Anchor there, or Keels come to caſt Coals or Ballaſt there. And it would hinder the paſſage of Ships in the ſaid River, and would be an injury to the Mayor and Burgeſſes to make an Act of Parliament to erect a Shore at the place deſired; for they do preſcribe, That no Shores ſhould be built upon that River, without their Licence; if this were not, the River had been long ſince blockt up, and it were impoſſible to prevent <hi>Nuſances</hi> to the ſaid River, if the Mayor and Burgeſſes had not the Survey and <hi>Government</hi> of it: For every Man that has Land upon the ſaid River, might be at liberty to build into the River as far as they pleaſe.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Preſcription</hi> has been likewiſe Tryed at Law at the Bar of the Court of Exchequer, and found for the Mayor and Burgeſſes: And why may not all, or any the Franchiſes of all other <hi>Corporations,</hi> be taken away by Act of Parliament as well as this? And there is no inconvenience to Ships that Trade to that Port, for want of a Shore there, becauſe there are Shores four or five Miles lower than <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> ſeated in convenient pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, where Ships caſt their Ballaſt, and take in their Coals without danger.</p>
            <p>The Mayor and Burgeſſes being Conſervators of the River and Port of <hi>Tine,</hi> (a place of great Import to the Kingdom, and Nurſery of Seamen and Navigation) and having an ancient Court for the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Preſervation of the River and Port, do never give leave to build a Ballaſt Shore, until the place be viewed by a Jury of Maſters of the <hi>Trinity Houſe</hi> and Pilots, and they upon their Oaths give a Verdict, that the place is convenient, and without prejudice to the River.</p>
            <p>That the <hi>Expedients</hi> propoſed, will not in any ſort leſſen the <hi>Price of Coals;</hi> for the ſame Tide that will carry Ships to the place deſigned for a Shore, will carry them to ſome other Shores or Wharfs that are already erected. And the ſame Wind that will carry Ships out from the one place, will carry them out from the other. And the Ballaſt is caſt out upon as cheap and eaſie terms from ſome of the other Shores already erected, as it can poſſibly be from the place deſigned for a Shore. Beſides, the Charges for Lighters to bring down Coals to Ships lying at <hi>Jarrowſlike,</hi> will be greater than the Rates are at the other Shores already erected upon the River. And Lighters which bring Coals to the Ships riding at <hi>Jarrowſlike,</hi> will not be able in great Weſterly Winds (which often happen) to go up again to fetch more Coals to Load the Ships there; although from the other Shores they may go up, notwithſtanding the greatneſs of the Wind.</p>
            <p>And in truth this is but a deſign for ſome particular Mens Intereſt, (upon pretence of publick good) which they have long endeavored by ſeveral means to effect at the Council Board, and at Law, but could not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail.</p>
